/**
 * Description:
 * The VelocityClosedLoop example demonstrates the velocity closed-loop servo.
 * Tested with Logitech F350 USB Gamepad inserted into Driver Station]
 * 
 * Be sure to select the correct feedback sensor using configSelectedFeedbackSensor() below.
 * Use Percent Output Mode (Holding A and using Left Joystick) to confirm talon is driving 
 * forward (Green LED on Talon/Victor) when the postion sensor is moving in the postive 
 * direction. If this is not the case, flip the boolean input in setSensorPhase().
 * 
 * Controls:
 * Button 1: When held, start and run Velocity Closed Loop on Talon/Victor
 * Left Joystick Y-Axis:
 * 	+ Percent Output: Throttle Talon forward and reverse, use to confirm hardware setup
 * 	+ Velocity Closed Loop: Servo Talon forward and reverse [-500, 500] RPM
 * 
 * Gains for Velocity Closed Loop may need to be adjusted in Constants.java
 * 
 * Supported Version:
 * - Talon SRX: 4.00
 * - Victor SPX: 4.00
 * - Pigeon IMU: 4.00
 * - CANifier: 4.00
